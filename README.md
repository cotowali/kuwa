## Q&A

### Why the name Kuwa

Kuwa is developed for [Kaico](https://github.com/cotowali/kaico)

In Japanese, Kaico means [Bombyx mori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombyx_mori) and Kuwa means [mulberry[(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morus_(plant)). Kaico eats Kuwa.

[Rowan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan) are trees. Kuwa are also trees.
